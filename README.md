## Overview
These utility classes provide a foundation for web automation tasks using Selenium WebDriver. The PageObjectModel class follows the POM pattern to represent web elements, while the ParameterDriver class manages WebDriver instances and provides methods for common actions like login and screenshot capture. These classes can be used as building blocks for creating more complex automated test scripts or web scraping routines.
